I chose this design because the functionality of this style window as we know it is useless due to the location. This lack of practical function makes it a bad design and makes its purpose unclear. While the design of the window itself has appropriate discoverability and understanding, its location indoors and design to easily slide open makes this original design out of the context of location more confusing
